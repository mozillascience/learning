###During the call

Now you can dive into the agenda items. Be gracious and alert as you go through each item. Your job is to be a bridge between each section and not the focal point.

* For each speaker:
  * Introduce each speaker with the same amount of enthusiasm
  * Listen to each speaker and help move into a meaningful discussion with the audience. Encourage questions in the etherpad.
  * Have a couple questions in mind in case the audience doesn't have questions or to give them time to get their questions in the pad
  * Read out any etherpad questions during the discussion
  * Keep an eye on the time! If you're short on time, cut the discussion short. Encourage asnyc etherpad q&a while you move on to the next section.

###Closing the call

* Thank everyone! Speakers AND participants.
* Let everyone know when the next call is
